# world-cup-26-predictions

## Project Type:
The project will be **analytical** in nature and we will also be **creating a tool** to demonstrate the predictive element of our project.

## Question of Interest:
Can we build a predictive model that leverages past world cup data alongside various external factors such as the weather in order to predict future outcomes for the upcoming world cup?

## Project output: Research & Tool (maybe a web app/dashboard)
- Provide weather conditions, teams, stadiums, match statistics, etc. 
- Provide insights into past matches with similar conditions
- Provide predictions on who will win using a ML model

## Data:
- [Fjelstul World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)
- Weather Dataset (multiple options)
